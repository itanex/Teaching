# Weekend Homework
Read through the entire [Material Design Documentation](https://material.io/guidelines/)

Using the Lesson6 CRUD processes that we built along with all the routing scenarios, complete the following.

#### MATERIAL DESIGN GAME LIBRARY
* Angular
* Angular-Material
* Angular-Ui-Route
* Full CRUD to manage game library
  * Create, Read, Update, Delete

#### STRETCH GOAL
Display the list of games as a set of Material Design Cards

#### BOOTSTRAP GAME LIBRARY
* Angular
* Bootstrap
* Angular-Ui-Route
* Full CRUD to manage game library
  * Create, Read, Update, Delete

#### STRETCH GOAL
Use Bootstrap Modals to open details, edit and delete views instead of routing.
