# C# Introduction Homework

####  ASSIGNMENT
Complete the following extensions and demonstrate their functionality in a Console Application.

* Create an extension method for String that returns the string as a correctly translated Pig-Latin interpretation
* Create an extension method for List<T> that returns a random element of the list

```Csharp
public static int Example<T>(this List<T> self)
{
	return 0;
}
```

#### STRETCH GOAL
* Utilize a Class Library instead of directly being part of the console application
   * Place extensions in the Class Library
   * Console application will only reference and use the library
